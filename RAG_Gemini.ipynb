      "This document outlines the new features and functionality included in the 2024 release of Warehouse Management and Transportation Execution for IBMi (WMi and TEi). Additional information on particular features is available in the WMi Online Help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intended Audience\n",
      "\n",
      "The release notes are targeted to persons familiar with WMi functionality. System evaluators (prospects and partners), current WMi customers, and internal Manhattan Associates employees will benefit from this overview.\n",

      "An inquiry screen is provided for the putwall slots so the user can view the inventory that is already placed into the slots as well as the inventory that is destined to be put into the slots. This enables users to gain a holistic view of all slots associated with the putwall, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of inventory management processes.\n",

      "Outbound Processing station support\n",
      "\n",
      "The outbound processing station is now accessible for putwall packing, enabling users to carry out a range of post-packing operations on cartons that have been packed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putwall Packing - Fixed station\n",
      "\n",
      "Putwall packing now offers a fixed station option, enhancing user experience by displaying additional transactional information such as ‘To be packed units’ and ‘Packed units’. This enables more convenient tracking of packing activities, improving overall efficiency in warehouse operations.\n",

      "WMi v2024 offers the functionality to associate multiple inbound shipments with a single inbound appointment. This feature simplifies the logistics process for customers handling multiple shipments within the same inbound appointment, eliminating the need for customizations or manual tracking through spreadsheets.\n",

      "Zone Balancing in Pick Location\n",
      "\n",
      "During the non-bulk allocation from active or case pick locations, the need for a specific product from all the orders for the wave is allocated together. In peak season, when the demand for fast-moving items increases, the entire need for a specific product may be allocated from the same determination zone. This can result in congestion in the aisle and location.' metadata={'source': 'mydata/WMI-RN.pdf'}\n",
